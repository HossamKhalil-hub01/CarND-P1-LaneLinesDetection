## Overview

This folder contains the results of each video in [test_vids](https://github.com/HossamKhalil-hub01/CarND-P1-LaneLinesDetection/tree/master/test_vids) folder after being processed by the pipeline.

There are also additional videos that demonstrate different steps of the pipeline for the same test video (solidWhiteRight), so that it's easier to visualize what is happening.

Those videos are:

* *canny_edge*: Demonstrates the canny edge detection step.
* *edge_colorThresh*: Demonstrates the color thresholding combined with the edge detection.
* *edge_colorThresh*: Demonstrates the detected lines after the horizontal lines filtering.

**Note:** If you uncommented the visualization section in `Lanelines_detection()` function found in [Lanelines_Detection.py](https://github.com/HossamKhalil-hub01/CarND-P1-LaneLinesDetection/blob/master/Lanelines_Detection.py) script, the resulting video will be automatically saved in this directory
